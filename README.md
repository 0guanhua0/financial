Welcome, fellow members of the Turtle Pond.

This repo is going to hold all my spreadsheets (santized) for the financials around the VMW->AVGO acquisition.

# Contents

The spreadsheet is exported from Google Sheets. I've tried opening it in Excel but it's not happy. If there are easy tweaks to make it comptiable that'll be my first change. Until then, import into Google Docs.

* Form 8937 for the two Dell dividends and the Broadcom acquisition (sourced from Broadcom 


# On use of Issues

I'm opening issues to track questions and feature requests. Feel free to do the same.

If it's also applicable to me, I'll get to them (no latency guarantees).  If not it'll be best effort.

### Form 8937
These forms detail tax handling for an event. This includes qualified/unqualified amounts, how to adjust cost-bases, how to calculate gain that must be realized, etc. These are pulled from the [Broadcom Invester Relations](https://investors.broadcom.com/financial-information/tax-information) site.

I'm planning on using the README.md to collate links to the various references I've used that informed the contents so people can double check, cross-reference, check citations,provide counter-examples, etc.... aka community.
