Welcome, fellow members of the Turtle Pond.

This repo is going to hold all my spreadsheets (santized) for the financials around the VMW->AVGO acquisition.
Current contents:
* [spreadsheet for ESPP & RSU basis and realized gain cacluations](https://github.com/hickeng/financial/raw/main/VMW%20to%20AVGO%20-%20ESPP%20&%20RSU%20worksheet.xlsx)

The spreadsheet is exported from Google Sheets. I've tried opening it in Excel but it's not happy. If there are easy tweaks to make it comptiable that'll be my first change. Until then, import into Google Docs.

I'm also planning on using the README.md to collate links to the various references I've used that informed the contents so people can double check, cross-reference, check citations,provide counter-examples, etc.... aka community.

Feel free to open issues for feature requests. If it's also applicable to me, I'll get to them (no latency guarantees).  If not it'll be best effort.
