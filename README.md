Welcome, fellow members of the Turtle Pond.

This rep is going to hold all my spreadsheets (santized) for the financials around the VMW->AVGO acquisition.

I'm also planning on using the README.md to collate links to the various references I've used that informed the contents so people can double check, cross-reference, check citations,provide counter-examples, etc.... aka community.

Feel free to open issues for feature requests. If it's also applicable to me, I'll get to them (no latency guarantees).  If not it'll be best effort.
